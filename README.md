# portfolio3

This portoflio was made with HTML, CSS, JS, and some jQuery

My name is Isaiah, a new software dev and this project was just to make a portfolio site made from scratch. 

Although I do have some web dev experience, it has mostly been for "fun" or "freelance" work. Other than that I actually come from a law enforcement background. 

I have added a few projects to this portfolio that I have built either by code along or by myself. 

This portfolio is responsive for the most part, however, if you look closely enough, im sure you will find some elements that did not quite respond to certain frame sizes correctly.
