            <a href="" class="featured-title">Isaiah Johnson</a>
            <p class="featured-desc">I am extremely passionate about coding, business, and FOOD! I've been coding for over 6 years, 10 if you consider me first starting in highschool, and I absolutely love it.
                As someone who comes from an artistic family, it is not foreign to know that art comes in more ways than just pen and paper. Bringing web designs to life, rather thats from a concept design, or something pulled
                from imagination, is nothing more than facinating to me. There is nothing more rewarding than knowing someone is actually willing to purchase something you created! I have created and sold a few businesses myself and
                I take pride in the work I do, and since modern businesses demand a functioning website, who better to get the job done than someone who understands both aspects of the fence. There is only one thing better than doing 
                what you love... and thats doing it with a plate of hot wings right next to you!
